# xworks - a dead-simple FAQ-style static site generator, Ã  la [anarchy.works](http://anarchy.works/)

## What do I give it?

A markdown file. use `#` for sections,
`##` for subsections, and `###` for sub-subsections.

## What do I get?

A HTML file, with the name same as the source, containing both what was in the markdown file as html and a table of contents appended to the top. It'll look just like  [anarchy.works](http://anarchy.works)!

## How do I use it?

```bash
xworks [source.md]
```

That's it.
